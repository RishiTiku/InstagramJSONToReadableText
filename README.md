# InstagramJSONToReadableText
This script can convert messages.json in your Instagram dump to readable separate text files for each user you've chatted with.

Hi There,

  Dumped all of your Instagram data? Messages.json is unreadable? This Code is Built just for you!
  
  Just place the messages.json file in the same folder as the script and run test.py. You'll find separate .txt files for each user in perfectly readable format.
                  Enjoy!!!

# To user
	Place the messages.json file in this folder (Containing this README file). Open the test.py file in IDLE (3.x or higher) and click on Run Module from Run Menu.
