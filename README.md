# InstagramJSONToReadableText
This script can convert messages.json in your Instagram dump to readable separate text files for each user you've chatted with.

Hi There,

  Dumped all of your Instagram data and Downloaded it? Messages.json is unreadable? This Code is Built just for you!
  
  Just place the messages.json file in the same folder as the script and run test.py. Use Python 3.x. You'll find separate .txt files for each user in perfectly readable format.
                  Enjoy!!! Be sure to leave a star and follow me if you like. :)
